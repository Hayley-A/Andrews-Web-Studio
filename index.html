                        <p>I grew up in the piney woods of East Texas where I would dream of what I wanted to be when I grew up.  It took 40 years to figure that out.  I've done everything from managing a restaurant to bookkeeping 
                            ...finding enjoyment in whatever I was doing and working hard at it.  But regardless of my career, nothing felt quite right.

                        <p>Through a series of unlikely events, I discovered web development and I fell in love.  I love that this career allows me the freedom to spend time with my husband and kids, while being rewarded with 
                            knowing that I'm adding a bit of common sense and beauty to the interwebs.  I love everything about designing customized and intuitive websites.
